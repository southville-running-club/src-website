-- A cancelled entry is still an entry, so the admin list stops hiding it.
--
-- =========================================================================================
-- What was wrong
-- =========================================================================================
-- `entries.cancel_entry()` **deletes the entrants** — deliberately, and that should stay: it
-- is what stops the club holding personal data for a race somebody is not running, and it is
-- tied to the retention promise `/nn/privacy/` publishes.
--
-- `entries.read_entry_list()` drove its rows from `entries.entrants` and inner-joined the
-- purchase. Put those two together and a refunded purchase **cannot appear on `/admin/nn/`
-- at all**. Nothing was lost from the database; it was unreachable from the only page a
-- volunteer reads.
--
-- Three symptoms, found on 27 August 2026 — issue #116:
--
--   1. The page's **Refunded** status filter could never match a row. A control promising a
--      view that cannot exist is worse than no control: somebody clicking it concludes there
--      have been no refunds.
--   2. The club had no way to see its own refunds. The one destructive action the surface
--      offers is Cancel, and its result was invisible from that surface. `entries.admin_audit`
--      records it and **nothing may read that table**, deliberately.
--   3. "2 of 2 shown" counted entrants while `/account/entries/` counted purchases, so the
--      same person saw three entries in one place and two in the other.
--
-- =========================================================================================
-- What changed, and what deliberately did not
-- =========================================================================================
-- One CTE. `rows_all` is now purchase-driven with the entrant **left** joined, so a purchase
-- with no entrant returns a row whose runner columns are null — which is exactly what
-- `entries.my_entries()` has always done, and `/account/entries/` already renders as "No
-- runner is recorded against this entry."
--
-- **The counts are untouched and were already right.** `paid`, `held`, `holds_returned` and
-- `attention` all read the purchase-grained `purchase` CTE. Only the row list was wrong.
--
-- **`holding` keeps its inner join**, and that is not an oversight — it is the capacity
-- predicate, capacity is measured in runners, and a cancelled entry returned its place.
--
-- **The three exports keep theirs too.** `ea`, `start-list` and `medical` are lists of
-- *runners*: a refunded entry has nobody to put on a start line, and including one would be
-- the defect rather than the fix. There is no financial export, so nothing there needs a
-- purchase grain.
