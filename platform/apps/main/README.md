# `apps/main` — the club website, and Nightingale Nightmare under `/nn`

Static Astro plus one Worker, serving `new.southvillerunningclub.co.uk`. At the Squarespace
cutover the hostname changes and nothing else does —
[ADR-007](../../../docs/architecture/decisions/adr-007-one-hostname-paths-not-subdomains.md).

**Currently a skeleton.** A holding page saying a new site is coming, and the race page at
`/nn/` with a timestamp fetched from Postgres by the Worker while it serves the request.

## Layout

```
src/pages/index.astro   The holding page — new.<apex>/
src/pages/nn/           Nightingale Nightmare — new.<apex>/nn
src/pages/404.astro
worker/routing.ts       Whether a path belongs to the timing Worker. Pure and tested
worker/index.ts         Forward /timing locally, then fill in the health timestamp
```

## The one routing decision

Everything on the hostname is this Worker's, **except `/timing`**.

In production Cloudflare dispatches `/timing/*` to `apps/timing` at the edge — a route
carrying a path beats a Custom Domain on the same hostname — so those requests never reach
this code. Locally there is no edge, so this Worker forwards them when `TIMING_ORIGIN` is
set.

**`TIMING_ORIGIN` is set at the top level and absent from `env.production`, and that
absence is load-bearing.** If it were ever set in production, the platform would be
proxying itself through an extra hop.

`isTimingPath` matches `/timing` and everything beneath it and nothing else — `/timings/`
and `/timing-results/` stay with the website, because those are addresses a future page
could legitimately want. That is asserted, not assumed.

| Local | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| http://localhost:8787/ | the holding page | this Worker |
| http://localhost:8787/nn/ | Nightingale Nightmare | this Worker |
| http://localhost:8787/timing | race timing | forwarded to :8788 |
| http://localhost:8787/membership/ | **404** | nothing built yet |

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # astro dev, fast loop — no Worker, so no timestamp
npm run dev:worker   # wrangler dev on :8787, the real runtime
npm run build        # static output to dist/
npm run test:worker  # Workers runtime tests. Needs dist/ — build first
```

## Environment

Both Supabase values live in `wrangler.jsonc` — **local at the top level, production under
`env.production`** — and both are safe to expose by design: row-level security is what
enforces access, not the key.

That split is the safe direction. A plain `wrangler deploy`, which is the command somebody
runs by accident, publishes a Worker with **no hostname and an unreachable database**.
Loud and harmless. The inverse would put localhost config on the live domain.

`env.production`'s Supabase block is byte-identical to `apps/timing`'s, and
`packages/shared/tests/unit/supabase-config.test.ts` fails if that ever stops being true —
because one database behind both applications is what makes a results archive derived from
timing data possible at all.

**No further variable should be needed.** If the build appears to want a service role key,
the row-level security policy is wrong and that is the thing to fix.

## Manual steps

The [accepted exception](../../../docs/foundations/requirements.md#everything-is-defined-as-code)
to everything-as-code: what was done, why, by whom, and how to redo it. The full procedure
is the [Cloudflare runbook](../../../docs/delivery/runbooks/cloudflare-setup.md).

**The hostname is not on this list.** It is the `routes` entry in `wrangler.jsonc`, and
Cloudflare creates the DNS record and issues the certificate from it.

| What | Why | By | How to redo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Create the Worker and connect Workers Builds_ | Git integration needs no API token in CI, so there is no deploy credential to leak | _pending_ | See the settings below |

### Workers Builds settings

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Worker name** | `src-main-production` |
| **Root directory** | **`platform`** — *not* `platform/apps/main` |
| **Build command** | `npm run build --workspace=apps/main` |
| **Deploy command** | `npx wrangler deploy --env production --config apps/main/wrangler.jsonc` |
| **Build watch paths** | `platform/apps/main/**`, `platform/packages/**`, `platform/package-lock.json` |

**The root directory is the part that is easy to get wrong.** `@src/shared` and `@src/db`
are npm workspace links, and they only exist because the install ran at `platform/`. Point
the root directory at `platform/apps/main` and Cloudflare installs *there* instead, the
links are never created, and the build fails on `Cannot find module '@src/shared'`.

**Build watch paths are not optional.** The free plan allows 500 builds a month, and
without them every push rebuilds every application — which is how that allowance gets spent
on no-ops. `platform/packages/**` must be in the list: a change to the shared timezone
module has to rebuild both applications.

After anything touching the zone, **send and receive a test email on a club address.** A
Worker custom domain cannot affect mail, and confirming it costs a minute.
