/**
 * Acceptance tests, against both front doors under the real Workers runtime.
 *
 * ## Read this before changing the server or worker settings
 *
 * This suite drives two `workerd` servers and up to three browser engines at once, so it
 * is the heaviest thing in the repository by a wide margin. Two rules keep it from taking
 * a laptop down, and both have been broken once already:
 *
 * 1. **The servers must not build.** `npm run test:e2e` builds first, then starts
 *    `preview` on an existing build. A `webServer` command that builds turns every run
 *    into a full OpenNext bundle, and a slow start makes Playwright look hung.
 * 2. **Workers are capped.** Unbounded, Playwright takes half the machine's cores and
 *    each one launches a browser against two workerd instances.
 *
 * See also `apps/timing/next.config.ts`, where `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()` is guarded
 * to `next dev` — unguarded it spawns a workerd instance per build worker.
